I am currently learning the GIT through GIT hub

Essentials: Repositories, Branches, Commits, Pull Requests

Repository - used to organise a single project(contains all the files and folder structure that the project needs)
README - a file with info about the project

Branch: is the way to work on a different versions of the repo at the same time
By default repo has one branch called master(definitive branch)
Use branch to experiment on different ideas before committing to master
Create Branch = Taking a copy or snapshot of the Master at that time
Pulling = If someone make any changes to the master while you are working on you own branch then you could pull in those changes to your branch 
Committing = This will commit the changes to your branch and not to the Master(that process is called Merging)
